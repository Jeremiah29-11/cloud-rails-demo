# Welcome to Photo Uploader

This is a sample Ruby on Rails application for the [SAP NetWeaver Cloud platform](
http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/cloud-platform).


This 'local' branch is intended for local development only:

  jruby -S rails server
  
The application is scaffolded around two models - photo and album, and allows you
to upload and manage photos, arranged in albums.
